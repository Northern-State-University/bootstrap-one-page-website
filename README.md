starter files for creating a basic one page html/css website, please **fork** this repository into your own repo. If you've forgotten how, please revisit this content: https://github.com/Northern-State-University/github-starter-course specifically: https://github.com/Northern-State-University/github-starter-course#-github-terms-to-know

Once you've successfully forked the files, please follow the below instructions. The file you should be working on is called ```one-page-website-starter.html``` **IF** you get stuck you can peek at the ```one-page-website-final.html```.

No matter how (un)comfortable :sweat_smile: you may feel about coding, there is something here for every level. The most important takeaway from this lesson is reading comprehension and following instructions. Don't be intimidated, you got this. Hints also exist in the ```one-page-website-starter.html``` file.

## Step 1
Let's view your live webpage in your repositiry, open ```one-page-website-starter.html``` here in GitHub

We need to use ```href``` to link the ```css/styles.css``` file (this styles our code to make it look nice in a web browswer, to our ```.html``` file.
