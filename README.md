# bootstrap-one-page-website :desktop_computer:

starter files for creating a basic one page html/css website, please fork this repository into your own repo. If you've forgotten how, please revisit this content: https://github.com/Northern-State-University/github-starter-course specifically: https://github.com/Northern-State-University/github-starter-course#-github-terms-to-know

Once you've successfully forked the files, please follow the below instructions. The file you should be working on is called ´one-page-website-starter.html´ *IF* you get stuck you can peek at the ´one-page-website-final.html´.

No matter how (un)comfortable :sweat_smile: you may feel about coding, there is something here for every level. The most important takeaway from this lesson is reading and following instructions. Hints also exist in the ´one-page-website-starter.html´ file.
